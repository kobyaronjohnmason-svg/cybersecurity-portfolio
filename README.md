# cybersecurity-portfolio
A structured collection of my cybersecurity projects, reports, labs, and hands‑on learning.
This repository documents my progression as I build practical skills across:

- Network security
- SOC analysis
- Vulnerability assessment
- Linux & server administration
- Threat intelligence
- Malware analysis
- Scripting & automation

My goal is to develop strong, industry‑ready capabilities and build a portfolio aligned with real‑world defensive and offensive security practices.
